Change detection by comparing two bitemporal images is one of the most fundamental challenges for dynamic monitoring of the Earth surface. To achieve this purpose, a seasonal invariant term is introduced to maximally suppress pseudochanges, whereas the MeGAN explores the transition patterns between adjacent images in a self-learning fashion.
