Timely and accurate classification and interpretation of high-resolution images are very important for urban planning and disaster rescue. However, as spatial resolution gets finer, it is increasingly difficultto recognize complex patterns in high-resolution remote sensing images. Deep learning offers an efficient strategy to fill the gap between complex image patterns and their semantic labels. However, due to the hierarchical abstract nature of deep learning methods, it is difficult to capture the precise outline of different objects at the pixel level.
