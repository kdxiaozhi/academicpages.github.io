Change detection by comparing two bitemporal images is one of the most fundamental challenges for dynamic monitoring of the Earth surface. In this article, we propose a metric learning-based generative adversarial network (GAN) (MeGAN) to automatically explore seasonal invariant features for pseudochange suppressing and real change detection.
