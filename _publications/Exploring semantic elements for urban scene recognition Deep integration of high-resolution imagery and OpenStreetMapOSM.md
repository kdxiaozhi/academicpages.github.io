Urban scenes refer to city blocks which are basic units of megacities, they play an important role in citizens¡¯ welfare and city management. Remote sensing imagery with largescale coverage and accurate target descriptions, has been regarded as an ideal solution for monitoring the urban environment. However, due to the heterogeneity of remote sensing images, it is difficult to access their geographical content at the object level, let alone understanding urban scenes at the block level. Recently, deep learning-based strategies have been applied to interpret urban scenes with remarkable accuracies.
