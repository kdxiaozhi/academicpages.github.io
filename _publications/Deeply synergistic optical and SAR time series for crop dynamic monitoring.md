Multi-temporal remote sensing imagery has been regarded as an effective tool to monitor cropland. But optical sensors often miss key stages for crop growth because of clouds, which poses challenges to many studies. The synergistic of SAR and optical data is expected to lift this problem, especially in areas with persistent cloud cover. However, due to the different characteristics of optical and SAR sensors, it is difficult to build a relationship between the two with most existing methods, let alone construct the long-time correlations to fill optic observation gaps using SAR data.
