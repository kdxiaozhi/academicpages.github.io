To generate high-quality hyperspectral samples, a self-attention generative adversarial adaptation network (SaGAAN) is proposed in this work. It aims to increase the number and quality of training samples to avoid the impact of over-fitting. Compared to the traditional GANs, the proposed method has two contributions:(1) it includes a domain adaptation term to constrain generated samples to be more realistic to the original ones; and (2) it uses the self-attention mechanism to capture the long-range dependencies across the spectral bands and further improve the quality of generated samples.
