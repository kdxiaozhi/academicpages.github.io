In this paper, we propose a spectral-spatial feature based classification (SSFC) framework that jointly uses dimension reduction and deep learning techniques for spectral and spatial feature extraction, respectively. In this framework, a balanced local discriminant embedding algorithm is proposed for spectral feature extraction from high-dimensional hyperspectral data sets.
